Brief explanation of q script

file: file: src/main/resources/q/query_5.q

Initial Output:

show "This is a q script"; prints "this is a q script" to the console.
Data Display:

data:1 3 5 7 9; creates a list of integers.
show data; prints the contents of the list.
show til 5; prints the first 5 integers starting from 0, i.e., 0 1 2 3 4.
Variable and Conditional Display:

a:50; sets the variable a to 50.
show a; prints the value of a, which is 50.
r:""; initializes an empty string r.
r: $[a>10; "true"; "false"]; sets r to "true" if a is greater than 10, otherwise "false".
show "r = ", r; prints "r = true" since a is 50.
Function and Iteration:

eachElement: {[i] show i}; defines a function eachElement that prints its argument.
each[eachElement; data]; applies eachElement to each item in data, printing each element of the list.
Loop Examples:

n: 5; sets n to 5.

do[n; show .z.i]; iterates from 0 to 4, printing each iteration index.

m:2; q:3; sets m to 2 and q to 3.

The nested do loops:

Outer loop iterates m times (2 iterations), each time setting iVal to the current index.
Inner loop iterates q times (3 iterations), each time printing the values of m, iVal, and the current index.
x:100; y:500; z:2; sets x, y, and z to 100, 500, and 2, respectively.

The nested do loops:

Outer loop iterates x times (100 iterations), each time setting xVal to the current index.
Middle loop iterates y times (500 iterations), each time setting yVal to the current index.
Inner loop iterates z times (2 iterations), each time printing the values of x, xVal, y, yVal, and the current index.
s:20; t:6; u:5; v:2; sets s, t, u, and v to 20, 6, 5, and 2, respectively.

The nested do loops:

Outer loop iterates s times (20 iterations), each time setting sVal to the current index.
Middle loop iterates t times (6 iterations), each time setting tVal to the current index.
Inner loop iterates u times (5 iterations), each time setting uVal to the current index.
Innermost loop iterates v times (2 iterations), each time printing the values of s, sVal, t, tVal, u, uVal, and the current index.
In summary, the code demonstrates basic operations such as variable assignment, conditional statements, and nested iterations with do loops to print various combinations of variable values.
